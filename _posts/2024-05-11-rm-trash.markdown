title:  "Bash: Remove files to trash"
---

After returning from holiday, my muscle memory failed and my fingers did something weird:
```sh
rm somethingiwantedtoremove -rf *
```

<!--more-->

Luckily it was not my home folder or anything else but a folder called `downloads`. It contained years of important stuff.

So I thought why `rm` does not allow undo?

There is a `trash-cli` command that uses the same trash can as Gnome. You can install it with apt:
```sh
sudo apt install trash-cli
```

Aliasing `rm` to is is probably not a good idea but you can block yourself from using `rm` and remind yourself to use the alternative instead. `rm` will still work in scripts.

```sh
alias rm='echo "Use \"trash\" instead or prepend a backslash: \"\\rm\"."; false'
alias trash="trash-put"
#alias trash="gio trash"
```

`trash-cli` (`trash-put`) should work with Gnome, Kde, Xfce. There is also a `gio trash` command for Gnome.
